    <h1>Information on mandatory COVID-19 vaccination in Austria</h1>
    
<p>For close on two years now, we have had to cope with enormous challenges due to the
coronavirus pandemic and we are still in the middle of all this. Recurring restrictions and
changing rules currently define our everyday lives: one way or another, every one of us is
affected by mandatory mask wearing, lockdowns, contact and access restrictions, short-
  time work, work from home, and home schooling.</p>

<p>The coronavirus vaccination has been available in Austria for more than a year. It is safe,
effective and provides reliable protection against a severe course of the disease. Ever since,
more than 7 in 10 persons have gotten vaccinated in Austria, thus making an essential
contribution to protecting their own health and that of their fellow citizens. Almost all of
them have received two vaccine doses. Most of them are already protected through the
  booster jab (third vaccine dose) – an important milestone!</p>

<p>Current scientific evidence shows that Omicron, the currently predominant virus variant in
Austria, is spreading much quicker than any previous variants, and therefore much more
people get infected. Therefore, active protection through vaccination will continue to be
very important for all of us also in future – also because we need to be prepared for and
protected against any further virus variants!</p>

<p>Due to updated medical recommendations, the validity of the vaccination certificates
(Green Pass) is modified:
<ul>
<li>As of 1 February 2022, the vaccination certificate for the first series of
vaccinations (2 vaccine doses or recovery + 1 vaccine dose) will only be valid
for 180 days.</li>
<li>
The vaccination certificate for the booster vaccination (3 vaccine doses or
recovery + 2 vaccine doses) will continue to be valid for 270 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>For travelling to Austria, vaccination certificates or other proofs of vaccination remain valid
for 270 days.</p>
<h2>Why do we need a general COVID-19 vaccine mandate?</h2>
<p>In spite of the fact that a majority of the population in Austria has already decided to get
vaccinated against the coronavirus, we need a higher vaccination coverage. This is the only
way for us to successfully contain the coronavirus pandemic and to regain our accustomed
liberties. For this reason, a general COVID-19 vaccine mandate will be introduced in Austrian
in February. This was preceded by wide-ranging discussions in the sphere of both politics
and society for us to be able to consider as many aspects and effects on communal life as
possible.</p>
<p>The decrease in hospitalisations and deaths among vaccinated persons goes to show that
the coronavirus vaccination is effective. The vaccine protects each and every individual, it
saves our hospitals from collapsing. The population needs a functioning healthcare system
to rely on, especially in times of a health crisis.</p>
<p>The Austrian Federal Government has decided to protect the population by introducing a
general COVID-19 vaccine mandate. From the age of 18, all persons living in Austria who are
not exempt from mandatory vaccination for medical reasons are required to get vaccinated
under the law. Persons not yet vaccinated against the coronavirus will regularly be informed
about the requirement to get vaccinated by way of a written reminder. Any person who
fails to comply with the statutory requirement to get vaccinated will have to expect
administrative penalties in future.</p>
<p>What it now takes is solidarity and the cooperation of all people living in Austria to enable
us to return to our familiar everyday lives that we have missed so dearly.
  Please make your contribution to achieving this goal!</p>

<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
    <p>Your Federal Government</p>
